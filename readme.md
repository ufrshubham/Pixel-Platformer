# Pixel Platformer

A 2D platformer made using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine

## Requirements

- Godot 3.4.4 Mono version

## Assets

- [Pixel Platformer](https://kenney.nl/assets/pixel-platformer) asset pack by [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/)

## Note

This project is created by following [HeartBeasts](https://www.youtube.com/c/uheartbeast)'s [Godot Pixel Platformer Tutorial/Code Along](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9FzW-m48fn16W1Sz5bhTd1ArQQv4f-Cm) series. The major difference between this and the original project (HeartBeast's version) is that, this version uses C# for scripting instead of GDScript.
